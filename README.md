## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Deploy on Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages** — no server needed.

3. Use the **Games App** to launch them inside XLITE.
4. Optionally enable **about:blank** cloaking in **Settings** for stealth usage.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Some websites (e.g., Google) block iframe loading.
- about:blank cloaking is not working ATM.
- No real file system persistence (notes and files are in-memory only).
- Social media and proxy integration (working on iframe only for beta) not yet available — coming soon.
